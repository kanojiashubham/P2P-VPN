# P2P VPN Development on Windows Server

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution on a Windows Server environment. The primary objective is to provide secure and reliable connectivity to remote users located in different geographical areas across the world. By leveraging Windows Server's remote access capabilities and configuring routers accordingly, this solution enables seamless communication between users while maintaining privacy and data integrity.

## Features

- **P2P Connectivity**: Establish secure connections between remote users without relying on a centralized server.
- **Windows Server Integration**: Utilize Windows Server features for VPN setup and management.
- **Remote Access**: Enable users to access resources securely from anywhere in the world.
- **Router Configuration**: Provide guidelines for configuring routers to facilitate VPN connections.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Windows Server installed and configured.
- Access to router settings for configuration changes.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Windows Server**: Set up Windows Server on your machine.

2. **Configure Remote Access**: Configure Remote Access on Windows Server to enable VPN functionality.

3. **Router Configuration**: Access your router's settings and configure port forwarding or VPN passthrough to allow VPN traffic to pass through.

4. **User Setup**: Create user accounts on the Windows Server for remote access. Ensure appropriate permissions are set.

5. **Connectivity Testing**: Test connectivity by connecting remotely from different locations using the configured VPN.

## Usage

1. **Connect to VPN**: On the remote user's end, configure VPN settings using the provided credentials and connection details.

2. **Access Resources**: Once connected, users can access resources on the network as if they were physically present within the network.

3. **Disconnect**: Disconnect from the VPN when the session is no longer required to conserve resources and maintain security.
